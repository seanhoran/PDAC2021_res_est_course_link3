The following Mineral Resource preamble and table has been excerpted from an S-K 1300 Technical Report and modified to change the company and project name and edited so that the disclosure included is no longer aligned to property disclosure requirements for mining registrants.  How many errors can you find? 

SLR Consulting Ltd (SLR) was retained by Keen Resources Inc. to prepare an independent Technical Report Summary on their Spodium zinc project (Spodium or the Project) in Brazil.  

There are three deposits on the project which contain the current Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves.  A feasibility study (FS) was completed in 2018, and construction began in July 2019.  Earthworks are complete, surface facilities are under construction, and production is scheduled to begin in 2022.

The SEC definitions for Mineral Resources in S-K 1300 were used for Mineral Resource classification which are consistent with Canadian Institute of Mining, Metallurgy and Petroleum (CIM) Definition Standards for Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (CIM (2014) definitions).  

The Mineral Resource estimate for the Project was completed by Keen Resources in two separate block models based on data available as at March 30, 2020.

A summary of the Spodium Mineral Resources, effective September 30, 2020, is provided in Table 11â€‘1.  Keen used a long-term forecast of the R$/US$ exchange rate of $3.67 in conversion of costs and metal prices between Brazilian Reais and US dollars.

The SLR QP has performed a detailed review of the Mineral Resource estimate completed by Keen, including the support data.  The SLR QP is of the opinion that the Mineral Resource estimate has been completed to a high standard and is suitable to support the estimation of Mineral Reserves.
