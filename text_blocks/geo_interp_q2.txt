You are tasked with building a Mineral Resource model for a hematite taconite deposit.  Your samples are based on a bench flotation process designed to mimic plant conditions, which concentrates iron in a reverse flotation process. A geological model and alteration model have been completed.

* Phosphorus is present in low concentrations throughout the iron formation and is deleterious.  Concentration at levels above the iron-pellet specification limit occurs where the iron formation has been weathered.

  * A large sill has protected much of the iron formation at depth from weathering.  Below this sill, high phosphorus values occur at the sill contact, and in areas with a high concentration of faulting.
  * Above the large sill, the iron formation is intruded by several smaller sills and pervasive oxidation dominates.  Most of the material above the sill is waste as a consequence.
  * Historical sampling did not include phosphorus, and it is inconsistently present in the database. 

* Silica alteration from intrusive filled sills, dykes, and faults impacts the iron concentration process in the plant and is considered deleterious.

Use the flow chart and graphs to determine how you will model and estimate iron, silica and phosphorus in concentrate.
